# riffs

Riffs lets you easily clip sections of a song ("riffs").

Give it a try at [riffs.run](http://riffs.run). Search for a song, drag the slider around to select start/end times, then create a clip!

_Note: This currently doesn't work in Safari because Apple doesn't support opus in webm containers._
